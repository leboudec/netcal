\par\indent February 24th, 2022, the Russian government launched something that most of us considered as unthinkable in the modern times: an unprovoked, ungrounded, full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. Residential buildings, hospitals and maternities are being bombed; cities are being starved in the hope that inhabitants surrender to the occupant. Lots of civilians die or are severely wounded. Millions of refugees leave the country when they can; those who escape take the risk of being killed by Russian soldiers.

\par\indent We believe that it is important that the world knows the truth about the military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian army. In some parts of the world, some information systems pretend that there is no war, but only a special operation caused by a dispute between neighbours. It is not ! It is an invasion caused by the Russian government, who is willing to cause tremendous sufferings to tens of millions of Ukrainian people and to its own population. Perhaps you are not directly concerned today, but tomorrow you, or friends of yours, or relatives of yours, might be involved in a similar situation in your country.
