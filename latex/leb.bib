	abstract = {Les nouvelles g{\'e}n{\'e}rations d'a{\'e}ronefs embarquent de plus en plus de syst{\`e}mes avioniques, pour augmenter {\`a} la fois la s{\'e}curit{\'e} et le confort des passagers, tout en maintenant une haute rentabilit{\'e} pour les compagnies a{\'e}riennes. Ces nouvelles fonctions entra{\^\i}nent une forte hausse des {\'e}changes de donn{\'e}es, ce qui n{\'e}cessite plus de d{\'e}bit et de possibilit{\'e}s d'interconnexion. Les bus classiques de communications avioniques ne peuvent r{\'e}pondre {\`a} cette nouvelle demande, ce qui a pouss{\'e} les constructeurs Airbus et Boeing {\`a} installer {\`a} bord un r{\'e}seau de communication utilisant la technologie Ethernet commut{\'e}. Le principal apport de cette th{\`e}se est le d{\'e}veloppement d'une m{\'e}thode de preuve du d{\'e}terminisme de ce type de r{\'e}seaux, d{\'e}monstration fondamentale pour permettre leur certification a{\'e}ronautique. Cette m{\'e}thode, utilisant la th{\'e}orie du Network Calculus, a {\'e}t{\'e} retenue par Airbus pour la certification du r{\'e}seau AFDX de l'A380. Nous proposons {\'e}galement des optimisations de ce r{\'e}seau (politiques de service des commutateurs, interconnexion des {\'e}l{\'e}ments r{\'e}seau) en vue d'am{\'e}liorer les r{\'e}sultats de son analyse de d{\'e}terminisme par la m{\'e}thode pr{\'e}c{\'e}dente. Enfin, nous proposons une extension de nature stochastique {\`a} notre m{\'e}thode d{\'e}terministe, qui pourrait dans le cadre d'un futur programme permettre de dimensionner au plus juste les ressources physiques du r{\'e}seau.},

aggregate scheduling. We derive an upper bound on the queuing
delay as a function of priority traffic utilization and the
maximum hop count of any flow, and the shaping parameters at the
network ingress. Our bound explodes at a certain utilization level
which is a function of the hop count. We show that for a general
network configuration and larger utilization utilization an upper
bound on delay, if it exists, must be a function of the number of
nodes and/or the number of flows in the network.},

                   is a critical part of the work of the Diffserv Working
                   Group. This document describes a PHB called Expedited
                   Forwarding. We show the generality of this PHB by
                   noting that it can be produced by more than one
                   mechanism and give an example of its use to produce at
                   least one service, a Virtual Leased Line. A recommended
                   codepoint for this PHB is given. A pdf version of this
                   document is available at

                   receiving a lower end-to-end delay and receiving more
                   overall throughput. Every best effort packet is tagged
                   as either green or blue. Green packets receive a low,
                   bounded queueing delay. To ensure blue packets do not
                   suffer as a result, green flows receive less throughput
                   during bouts of congestion.},

	abstract = {The biochemical reaction networks include elementary reactions differing by many orders of magnitude in the numbers of molecules involved. The kinetics of reactions involving small numbers of molecules can be studied by exact stochastic simulation. This approach is not practical for the simulation of metabolic processes because of the computational cost of accounting for individual molecular collisions. We present the "maximal time step method," a novel approach combining the Gibson and Bruck algorithm with the Gillespie tau-leap method. This algorithm allows stochastic simulation of systems composed of both intensive metabolic reactions and regulatory processes involving small numbers of molecules. The method is applied to the simulation of glucose, lactose, and glycerol metabolism in Escherichia coli. The gene expression, signal transduction, transport, and enzymatic activities are modeled simultaneously. We show that random fluctuations in gene expression can propagate to the level of metabolic processes. In the cells switching from glucose to a mixture of lactose and glycerol, random delays in transcription initiation determine whether lactose or glycerol operon is induced. In a small fraction of cells severe decrease in metabolic activity may also occur. Both effects are epigenetically inherited by the progeny of the cell in which the random delay in transcription initiation occurred.},

@article{Cao-JCP05,
	abstract = {Reactions in real chemical systems
often take place on vastly different time scales, with "fast"
reaction channels firing very much more frequently than "slow" ones.
These firings will be interdependent if, as is usually the case, the
fast and slow reactions involve some of the same species. An exact
stochastic simulation of such a system will necessarily spend most
of its time simulating the more numerous fast reaction events. This
is a frustratingly inefficient allocation of computational effort
when dynamical stiffness is present, since in that case a fast
reaction event will be of much less importance to the system's
evolution than will a slow reaction event. For such situations, this
paper develops a systematic approximate theory that allows one to
stochastically advance the system in time by simulating the firings
of only the slow reaction events. Developing an effective strategy
to implement this theory poses some challenges, but as is
illustrated here for two simple systems, when those challenges can
be overcome, very substantial increases in simulation speed can be
realized.},

                 and relies exclusively on local interactions between the
                 network nodes to create global transmission patterns. A
                 transmission inhibits other transmissions in its
                 immediate surrounding and encourages nodes located
                 further away to transmit. The transmission patterns
                 created by our medium access control scheme combine the
                 efficiency of allocation-based schemes at high traffic
                 loads and the flexibility of random access schemes.
                 Moreover, we show that with appropriately chosen

                 dissemination service for ad-hoc environments that is
                 broadcast in nature, but is limited to a local scope
                 around each source. Example applications are chatting or
                 bulletin boards in a traffic jam, in an instant crowd in
                 a campus or, in contrast, along a desert highway. Our
                 goal is to support such a service across a wide range of
                 conditions (dense or sparse). The main problems are to
                 adaptively control scoping and traffic rates. We propose
                 a system design with the following elements: (1)
                 manipulation of TTL by adaptive aging mechanisms; (2)
                 control of forwarding factor by self-inhibition and
                 inter-inhibition and (3) control of rate of injection by
                 sources. We analyze our design using a mean field and
                 ordinary differential equation approach borrowed from
                 population dynamics, and show how it can be tuned to
                 achieve an appropriate balance between limitation of
                 scope and rate of information. We validate the design by
                 an implementation in Java. We assess the performance of
                 the design by analysis and by using the Java
                 implementation in a simulated MAC layer environment. Our
                 design is entirely self-organized, and is free of any
                 form of clustering or leader election.},

                 aggregation into clusters emerges solely from local

                 probabilities to join or leave a cluster are a function

                 spatial distribution of robots in the environment, we
                 propose a population dynamics model that keeps track of
                 the number of robots in clusters of specific size. The
                 model is able to quantitatively and qualitatively predict

                 evolution of each object is given by a finite state
                 Markov chain, whose transition matrix depends on the
                 present and the past of the distribution of states of all
                 objects. This is a general model of wide applicability;
                 we mention as examples: TCP connections, HTTP flows,

                 system converges to a deterministic dynamical system (the
                 ``mean field") with dimension the number of states of an
                 individual object. We also prove a fast simulation

                 second design choice is to use an acquisition sequence
                 private to destinations. It potentially yields a larger
                 network throughput, but requires additional complexity
                 for sources to learn the acquisition sequence of their
                 destination. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of a
                 common or private acquisition sequence on the network
                 throughput. Our analysis is based on analytical modeling
                 and simulations. We show that a private acquisition
                 sequence yields a substantial increase in throughput. The
                 throughput difference grows with the number of concurrent
                 transmitters and interferers. We also show the presence
                 of a compounding effect similar to the exposed terminal
                 issue in 802.11 networks.},

	abstract = {We consider models of $N$ interacting objects, where the
                 interaction is via a common resource and the distribution
                 of states of all objects. We consider the case where the
                 number of transitions per time slot per object vanishes
                 as $N$ grows. We show that, under mild assumptions and
                 for large $N$, the occupancy measure converges, in
                 probability and in mean square over any finite horizon,
                 to a deterministic dynamical system. Our method of proof
                 is inspired by stochastic approximation algorithms. The
                 convergence results allow us to derive properties valid
                 in the stationary regime. We use this to develop a
                 critique of the fixed point method sometimes used in
                 conjunction with the decoupling assumption.},

@article{LCA-ARTICLE-2007-004,
	abstract = {We define "random trip", a generic mobility model for
                 random, independent node motions, which contains as
                 special cases: the random waypoint on convex or nonconvex
                 domains, random walk on torus, billiards, city section,
                 space graph, intercity and other models. We show that,
                 for this model, a necessary and sufficient condition for
                 a time-stationary regime to exist is that the mean trip
                 duration (sampled at trip endpoints) is finite. When this
                 holds, we show that the distribution of node mobility
                 state converges to the time-stationary distribution,
                 starting from the origin of an arbitrary trip. For the
                 special case of random waypoint, we provide for the first
                 time a proof and a sufficient and necessary condition of
                 the existence of a stationary regime, thus closing a long
                 standing issue. We show that random walk on torus and
                 billiards belong to the random trip class of models, and
                 establish that the time-limit distribution of node
                 location for these two models is uniform, for any initial
                 distribution, even in cases where the speed vector does
                 not have circular symmetry. Using Palm calculus, we
                 establish properties of the time-stationary regime, when
                 the condition for its existence holds. We provide an
                 algorithm to sample the simulation state from a
                 time-stationary distribution at time 0 ("perfect
                 simulation"), without computing geometric constants. For
                 random waypoint on the sphere, random walk on torus and
                 billiards, we show that, in the time-stationary regime,
                 the node location is uniform. Our perfect sampling
                 algorithm is implemented to use with ns-2, and is
                 available to download from

@article{402/LCA,
	abstract = {We compare the performance of ABR and UBR for providing
                 high-speed network interconnection services for TCP
                 traffic. We test the hypothesis that UBR with adequate
                 buffering in the ATM switches results in better overall
                 goodput for TCP traffic than explicit rate ABR for LAN
                 interconnection. This is shown to be true in a wide
                 selection of scenarios. Four phenomena that may lead to
                 bad ABR performance are identified and we test whether
                 each of these has a significant impact on TCP goodput.
                 This reveals that the extra delay incurred in the ABR
                 end-systems and the overhead of RM cells account for the
                 difference in performance. We test whether it is better
                 to use ABR to push congestion to the end-systems in a
                 parking-lot scenario or whether we can allow congestion
                 to occur in the network. Finally, we test whether the
                 presence of a `multiplexing loop` causes performance
                 degradation for ABR and UBR. We find our original
                 hypothesis to be true in all cases. We observe, however,
                 that ABR is able to improve performance when the
                 buffering inside the ABR part of the network is small
                 compared to that available at the ABR end-systems. We
                 also see that ABR allows the network to control fairness
                 between end-systems.},

@inproceedings{LCA-CONF-2009-013,
	abstract = {We introduce Markov Decision Evolutionary Games with N
                 players, in which each individual in a large population
                 interacts with other randomly selected players. The
                 states and actions of each player in an interaction
                 together determine the instantaneous payoff for all
                 involved players. They also determine the transition
                 probabilities to move to the next state. Each individual
                 wishes to maximize the total expected discounted payoff
                 over an infinite horizon. We provide a rigorous
                 derivation of the asymptotic behavior of this system as
                 the size of the population grows to infinity. We show
                 that under any Markov strategy, the random process
                 consisting of one specific player and the remaining
                 population converges weakly to a jump process driven by
                 the solution of a system of differential equations. We
                 characterize the solutions to the team and to the game
                 problems at the limit of infinite population and use
                 these to construct almost optimal strategies for the case
                 of a finite, but large, number of players. We show that
                 the large population asymptotic of the microscopic model
                 is equivalent to a (macroscopic) Markov decision
                 evolutionary game in which a local interaction is
                 described by a single player against a population
                 profile. We illustrate our model to derive the equations
                 for a dynamic evolutionary Hawk and Dove game with energy

@techreport{reput-report-2010,
	abstract = {The bounded confidence model of opinion dynamics,
                 introduced by Deffuant et al., is a stochastic model for
                 the evolution of [0,1]-valued opinions within a finite
                 group of peers. We show that as time goes to infinity,
                 the opinions evolve into a random non-interacting set of
                 clusters, and subsequently the opinions in each cluster
                 converge to their barycenter; the limit empirical
                 distribution is called a partial consensus. Then, we
                 prove a mean-field limit result: for i.i.d. initial
                 opinions, as the number of peers increases and time is
                 rescaled accordingly, the peers asymptotically behave as
                 i.i.d. peers, each influenced by opinions drawn
                 independently from the unique solution of a nonlinear
                 integro-differential equation. As a consequence, the
                 (random) empirical distribution process converges to this
                 (deterministic) solution. We also show that as time goes
                 to infinity, this solution converges to a partial
                 consensus, and identify sufficient conditions for the
                 limit not to depend on the initial condition, and for
                 formation of total consensus. Finally, we show that if
                 the equation has an initial condition with a density,
                 then its solution has a density at all times, develop a
                 numerical scheme to solve the corresponding functional
                 equation of the Kac type, and show, using numerical
                 examples, that bifurcations may occur.},

@article{LCA-ARTICLE-2008-034,
	abstract = {For impulse-radio ultra-wide band (IR-UWB) networks
                 without global synchronization, the first step for
                 correct packet reception is packet detection and timing
                 acquisition: Before recovering the payload of the packet,
                 the destination must detect that the packet is on the
                 medium and determine when exactly the payload begins.
                 Packet detection and timing acquisition rely on the
                 presence of an acquisition preamble at the beginning of
                 each packet. How this preamble is chosen is a network
                 design issue and it may have quite an impact on the
                 network performance. A simple design choice of the
                 network is to use a common acquisition preamble for the
                 whole network. A second design choice is to use an
                 acquisition preamble that is private to each destination.
                 The throughput with the latter choice is likely to be
                 much higher, albeit at the cost of learning the private
                 acquisition preamble of a destination. In this paper, we
                 evaluate how using a common or private acquisition
                 preambles affects the network throughput. Our analysis is
                 based on analytical modeling and simulations. Using our
                 analytical model, we show that a private acquisition
                 preamble yields a tremendous increase in throughput
                 compared to a common acquisition preamble. The throughput
                 difference grows with the number of concurrent
                 transmitters and interferers. This result is confirmed by
                 simulations. Furthermore, additional simulations on
                 multi-hop topologies with TCP flows demonstrate that a
                 network using private acquisition preambles has a stable
                 throughput. On the contrary, using a common acquisition
                 preamble exhibits the presence of a compounding effect
                 similar to the exposed terminal issue in IEEE 802.11
                 networks: the throughput is severely degraded and
                 complete flow starvation may occur.},

                 made of a large number of objects to optimization
                 problems on ordinary differential equations (ODE). We
                 show that the optimal reward of such a Markov Decision
                 Process, satisfying a Bellman equation, converges to the
                 solution of a continuous Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)
                 equation based on the mean field approximation of the
                 Markov Decision Process. We give bounds on the difference
                 of the rewards, and a constructive algorithm for deriving
                 an approximating solution to the Markov Decision Process
                 from a solution of the HJB equations. We illustrate the

@techreport{EPFL-REPORT-152160,
	abstract = {Assume that a stochastic processes can be approximated,
                 when some scale parameter gets large, by a fluid limit
                 (also called ``mean field limit", or ``hydrodynamic
                 limit"). A common practice, often called the ``fixed
                 point approximation" consists in approximating the
                 stationary behaviour of the stochastic process by the
                 stationary points of the fluid limit. It is known that
                 this may be incorrect in general, as the stationary
                 behaviour of the fluid limit may not be described by its
                 stationary points. We show however that, if the
                 stochastic process is reversible, the fixed point
                 approximation is indeed valid. More precisely, we assume
                 that the stochastic process converges to the fluid limit
                 in distribution (hence in probability) at every fixed
                 point in time. This assumption is very weak and holds for
                 a large family of processes, among which many mean field
                 and other interaction models. We show that the
                 reversibility of the stochastic process implies that any
                 limit point of its stationary distribution is
                 concentrated on stationary points of the fluid limit. If
                 the fluid limit has a unique stationary point, it is an
                 approximation of the stationary distribution of the
                 stochastic process. },

	et al, is a stochastic model for the evolution of continuous-valued
	opinions within a finite group of peers. We prove that, as time goes
	to infinity, the opinions evolve globally into a random set of clusters
	too far apart to interact, and thereafter all opinions in every cluster
	converge to their barycenter. We then prove a mean-field limit result,
	propagation of chaos: as the number of peers goes to infinity in
	adequately started systems and time is rescaled accordingly, the
	opinion processes converge to i.i.d. nonlinear Markov (or McKean-Vlasov)
	processes; the limit opinion processes evolves as if under the influence
	of opinions drawn from its own instantaneous law, which are the unique
	solution of a nonlinear integro-differential equation of Kac type.
	This implies that the (random) empirical distribution processes converges
	to this (deterministic) solution. We then prove that, as time goes
	to infinity, this solution converges to a law concentrated on isolated
	opinions too far apart to interact, and identify sufficient conditions
	for the limit not to depend on the initial condition, and to be concentrated
	at a single opinion. Finally, we prove that if the equation has an
	initial condition with a density, then its solution has a density
	at all times, develop a numerical scheme for the corresponding functional
	equation, and show numerically that bifurcations may occur.},

                 of clusters too far apart to interact, and thereafter all
                 opinions in every cluster converge to their barycenter.
                 We then prove a mean-field limit result, propagation of
                 chaos: as the number of peers goes to infinity in
                 adequately started systems and time is rescaled
                 accordingly, the opinion processes converge to i.i.d.
                 nonlinear Markov (or McKean-Vlasov) processes; the limit
                 opinion processes evolves as if under the influence of
                 opinions drawn from its own instantaneous law, which are
                 the unique solution of a nonlinear integro-differential
                 equation of Kac type. This implies that the (random)
                 empirical distribution processes converges to this
                 (deterministic) solution. We then prove that, as time
                 goes to infinity, this solution converges to a law
                 concentrated on isolated opinions too far apart to
                 interact, and identify sufficient conditions for the
                 limit not to depend on the initial condition, and to be
                 concentrated at a single opinion. Finally, we prove that
                 if the equation has an initial condition with a density,
                 then its solution has a density at all times, develop a
                 numerical scheme for the corresponding functional
                 equation, and show numerically that bifurcations may
                 occur.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of controlling the electrical  state of a three-phase distribution network by enforcing  the explicit power injection. More precisely, we assume  that the power injection is constrained to reside in some  uncertainty set, and the problem is to ensure that the  electrical state remains in a set that satisfies  feasibility constraints. To formalize this, we say that a  set S of power injections is a "domain of V-control" if any  continuous trajectory of the electrical state that starts  in the set V must stay in V as long as the corresponding  trajectory of the power injection stays in S. First, we  show that the existence and uniqueness of load-flow  solution is not enough to guarantee V-control, and give  sufficient additional conditions for V-controllability to  hold. Incidentally, the derivation of our conditions  establishes that local uniqueness implies nonsingularity of  the load-flow Jacobian (the converse is well known by the  Inverse Function Theorem). Then, we give a concrete  algorithm to determine whether a given set of power  injections is a domain of V-control for some feasible and  nonsingular set V. The algorithm is evaluated on IEEE test  feeders. Our method can be used to perform admissibility  tests in the control of distribution networks by power  injections.},

@article{Reyes-Chamorro:234511,
	abstract = {The existing approaches to control electrical grids  combine frequency and voltage controls at different  time-scales. When applied in microgrids with stochastic  distributed-generation, grid quality of service problems  may occur, such as under- or overvoltages as well as  congestion of lines and transformers. The COMMELEC  framework proposes to solve this compelling issue by  performing explicit control of power flows with two novel  strategies: (1) a common abstract model is used by  resources to advertise their state in real time to a grid  agent; (2) subsystems can be aggregated into virtual  devices that hide their internal complexity in order to  ensure scalability. While the framework has already been  published in the literature, in this paper we present the  first experimental validation of a practicable explicit  power-flow primary control applied in a real-scale test-bed  microgrid. We demonstrate how an explicit power-flow  control solves the active and reactive power sharing  problem in real time, easily allowing the microgrid to be  dispatchable in real time (i.e. it is able to participate  in energy markets) and capable of providing frequency  support, while always maintaining the quality of service.},
