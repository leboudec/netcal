\begin{definition} [Leaky Bucket Controller]
A Leaky Bucket Controller is a device that analyzes the data on a
flow $R(t)$ as follows. There is a pool (bucket) of fluid of size
$b$. The bucket is initially empty. The bucket has a hole and
leaks at a rate of $r$ units of fluid per second when it is not
empty.

Data from the flow $R(t)$ has to pour into the bucket an amount of
fluid equal to the amount of data. Data that would cause the
bucket to overflow is declared non-conformant, otherwise the data
is declared conformant.
\end{definition}
Figure~\ref{leabu} illustrates the definition.  Fluid in the leaky
bucket does not represent data, however, it is counted in the same
unit as data.

Data that is not able to pour fluid into the bucket is said to be
``non-conformant'' data. In ATM systems, non-conformant data is
either discarded, tagged with a low priority for loss (``red''
cells), or can be put in a buffer (buffered leaky bucket
controller). With the Integrated Services Internet, non-conformant
data is in principle not marked, but simply passed as best effort
traffic (namely, normal IP traffic).

  level of the bucket $x(t)$ for a sample input, with $r=0.4$ kbits per time
  unit and $b=1.5$ kbits. The packet arriving at time $t=8.6$ is not
  conformant, and no fluid is added to the bucket. If $b$ would be
  equal to $2$ kbits, then all packets would be conformant.}

We want now to show that a leaky bucket controller enforces an
arrival curve constraint equal to $\gamma_{r,b}$. We need the
following lemma.
\begin{lemma}
        \mylabel{lem-buf-simple}
        Consider a buffer served at a constant rate $r$. Assume that the
        buffer is empty at time $0$. The input is described by the cumulative
        function $R(t)$. If there is no overflow during $[0,t]$, the buffer
        content at time $t$ is given by
        $$
        x(t)=\sup_{s : s \leq t} \{ R(t) - R(s) -r (t-s)\}
        $$
\end{lemma}
\pr The lemma can be obtained as a special case of
Corollary~\ref{coro-shaper-buffer-occupancy} on
page~\pageref{coro-shaper-buffer-occupancy}, however we give here
a direct proof. First note that for all $s$ such that $s\leq t$,
$(t-s)r$ is an upper bound on the number of bits output in
$]s,t]$, therefore:
$$
R(t)-R(s) - x(t) +x(s) \leq (t-s)r
$$

Thus
$$
x(t) \geq R(t)-R(s) + x(s) - (t-s)r \geq R(t)-R(s) - (t-s)r
$$

which proves that $x(t) \geq \sup_{s : s \leq t} \{ R(t) - R(s) -r
(t-s)\}$.

Conversely, call $t_{0}$ the latest time at which the buffer was
empty before time $t$: $$t_{0} = \sup \{s: s\leq t, x(s) = 0\}$$
(If $x(t)  > 0$ then $t_{0}$ is the beginning of the busy period
at time $t$). During $]t_{0}, t]$, the queue is never empty,
therefore it outputs bit at rate $r$, and thus
\begin{equation} \mylabel{eq-d4-37443}
        x(t)=x(t_{0 })+R(t)-R(t_{0 }) - (t-t_{0 })r
\end{equation}

We assume that $R$ is left-continuous (otherwise the proof is a
little more complex); thus $x(t_{0 })=0$ and thus $x(t) \leq
\sup_{s : s \leq t} \{ R(t) - R(s) -r (t-s)\}$ %\qed

Now the content of a leaky bucket behaves exactly like a buffer
served at rate $r$, and with capacity $b$. Thus, a flow $R(t)$ is
conformant if and only if the bucket content $x(t)$ never exceeds
$b$. From Lemma~\ref{lem-buf-simple}, this means that
$$
\sup_{s : s \leq t} \{ R(t) - R(s) -r (t-s)\} \leq b
$$
which is equivalent to
$$
R(t)-R(s) \leq r(t-s) +b
$$
for all $s \leq t$. We have thus shown the following.
\begin{proposition}
A leaky bucket controller with leak rate $r$ and bucket size $b$
forces a flow to be constrained by the arrival curve
$\gamma_{r,b}$, namely:
\begin{enumerate}
        \item  the flow of conformant data has $\gamma_{r,b}$ as an arrival
        curve;
\item  if the input already has $\gamma_{r,b}$ as an arrival
        curve, then all data is conformant.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
