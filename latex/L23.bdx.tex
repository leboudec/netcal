Assume that $R \rightarrow (\tilde{\beta}, \beta) \rightarrow
R^*$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Show that the node offers to the flow a strict service
curve equal to $\tilde{\beta}\mpc \overline{\beta}$, where
$\overline{\beta}$ is the sub-additive closure of $\beta$.
  \item If $\tilde{\beta}=\beta$ is a rate-latency function, what is the
  value obtained for the strict service curve~?

\begin{problem}
 Consider a system with
input $R$ and output $R^*$. We call ``input flow restarted at time
$t$" the flow $R_t$ defined for $u \geq 0$ by
$$
R_t(u)=R(t+u)-R^*(t) = R(t,u]+Q(t)
$$
where $Q(t):=R(t)-R^*(t)$ is the backlog at time $t$. Similarly,
let the``output flow restarted at time $t$" be the flow $R^*_t$
defined for $u \geq 0$ by
$$R^*_t(u)=R^*(t+u)-R^*(t)$$
Assume that the node guarantees a service curve $\beta$ to all
couples of input, output flows $(R_t, R^*_t)$. Show that $R
\rightarrow (\beta) \rightarrow R^*$.
