\begin{problem}
Consider a variable capacity network node, with capacity curve
$M(t)$. Show that there is one maximum function $S^*(t)$ such that
for all $0 \leq s \leq t$, we have
$$M(t)-M(s) \geq S^*(t-s)
$$
Show that $S^*$ is super-additive.

Conversely, if a function $\beta$ is super-additive, show that
there is a variable capacity network node, with capacity curve
$M(t)$, such that for all $0 \leq s \leq t$, we have $M(t)-M(s)
\geq S^*(t-s) $.

Show that, with a notable exception, a shaper cannot be modeled as
a variable capacity node.
