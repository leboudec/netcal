\begin{problem}
Consider the example of \fref{fig-dsnet1}. Apply the method of
\sref{sec-timestoppingm} but express now that the fraction of
input traffic to node $i$ that originates from another node must
have $\lambda_C$ as an arrival curve . What is the upper-bound on
utilization factors for which a bound is obtained ?
