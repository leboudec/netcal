\begin{problem}
Assume all nodes in a network are made of a shaper followed by a
FIFO multiplexer. Assume that flow $I$ has T-SPEC,
$\alpha_i(t)=\min(r_it+b_i, M+p_it)$, that the shaper at every
node uses the shaping curve $\sigma_i=\gamma_{r_i,b_i}$ for flow
$i$. Find the schedulability conditions for every node.
