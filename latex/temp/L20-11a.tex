 \begin{problem}
 Consider a flow $R(t)$ receiving a minimum service curve
 guarantee $\beta$. Assume that
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\beta$ is concave and wide-sense increasing
  \item the $\inf$ in $R \mpc \beta$ is a $\min$
 \end{itemize}
For all $t$, call $\tau(t)$ a number such that
$$
(R \mpc \beta)(t)= R(\tau(t)) + \beta(t-\tau(t))
$$
Show that it is possible to choose $\tau$ such that if $t_1 \leq
t_2$ then  $\tau(t_1) \leq \tau(t_2)$.
 \sol{~\\Call $\tau_1=\tau(t_1)$ and
consider any $t' \leq \tau_1$. From the definition of $\tau_1$, we
have
$$
S(t') + \beta(t_1 - t' ) \geq S(\tau_1) + \beta(t_1 - \tau_1 )
$$
and thus
$$
S(t') + \beta(t_2 - t' ) \geq S(\tau_1) + \beta(t_1 - \tau_1 ) -
\beta(t_1 - t' ) + \beta(t_2 - t' )
$$
Now $\beta$ is convex, thus for any four numbers $a, b, c, d$ such
that $a \leq c  \leq b$,  $a \leq d  \leq b$ and $a+b=c+d$, we
have
$$\beta(a) + \beta(b) \geq \beta(c) + \beta(d)$$
(the interested reader will be convinced by drawing a small
figure). Applying this to $a=t_1- \tau_1, b=t_2 - t', c=t_1-t',
d=t_2-\tau_1$ gives
$$
S(t')+ \beta(t_2-t') \geq S(\tau_1)+\beta(t_2 - \tau_1)
$$
and the above equation holds for all $t'\leq \tau_1$. Consider now
the minimum, for a fixed $t_2$, of $S(t') +\beta(t_2-t')$ over all
$t' \leq t_2$. The above equation shows that the minimum is
reached for some $t' \geq \tau_1$.}
