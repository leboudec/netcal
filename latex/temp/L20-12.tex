        \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Find the maximum backlog and maximum delay for an ATM
                CBR connection with peak rate $P$ and cell delay variation
                $\tau$, assuming the service curve is $c(t) = r(t-T_{0})^{+}$
\sol{The CBR connection is defined by
        GCRA($\frac{\delta}{P}$, $\tau$)\\
        if p<r then,
        BackLog = \(B+PT_0\)\\
        Maximum Delay = \( \frac{B}{r}+T_0 \)\\
        otherwise,  backlog and max, delay are infinity.}
