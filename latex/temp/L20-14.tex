\begin{enumerate}
                \item Find the the arrival curve constraining the output for
                an ATM CBR connection with peak rate $P$ and cell delay
                variation $\tau$, assuming the service curve is $c(t) =
                r(t-T_{0})^{+}$

                \item Find the arrival curve constraining the output
                for an ATM VBR connection with peak rate $P$, cell delay
                variation $\tau$, sustainable cell rate $M$ and burst
                tolerance $\tau_{B}$ (in seconds), assuming the service curve
                is $c(t) = r(t-T_{0})^{+}$
