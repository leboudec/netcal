\begin{problem}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute the effective bandwidth for a mix of VBR
    connections $1, \ldots, I$.

    \item Show how the homogeneous case can be derived from your formula

    \item Assume $K$ connections, each with peak rate $p$, sustainable rate
    $m$ and burst tolerance $b$, are offered to a trunk with constant
    service rate $P$ and FIFO buffer of capacity $X$. Find the
    conditions on $K$ for the system to be loss-free.

    \item  Assume that there are two classes of connections, with
    $K_{i}$ connections in class $i$, $i=1,2$, offered to a trunk with constant
    service rate $P$ and FIFO buffer of infinite capacity $X$. The
    connections are accepted as long as their queuing delay does
    not exceed some value $D$.
    Draw the acceptance region, that is, the set of $(K_{1}, K_{2})$
    that are accepted by CAC2. Is the
    acceptance region convex ? Is the complementary of the
    acceptance region in the positive orthant convex ? Does this
    generalize to more than two classes ?
\end{enumerate}
