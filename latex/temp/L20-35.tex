 \begin{problem}
 Consider a node that offers to a flow $R(t)$ a rate-latency
 service curve $\beta= S_{R,L}$. Assume that $R(t)$ is $L$-packetized, with
 packet arrival times called $T_1, T_2,...$  (and
 is left-continuous,
 as usual)

 Show that
 $(R\mpc \beta)(t) = \min_{T_i \in [0, t]} [R(T_i) + \beta(t-T_i)]$
  (and thus, the $\inf$ is attained).
\sol{ For a fixed $t$, study the function of $s$ given by $R(s) +
\beta(t-s)$. For $T_{i-1} < s \leq T_i$ we have $R(s)=R(T_i)$ thus
the $\inf$ for $s \in (T_{i-1}, T_i]$ is attained at $T_i$.}
 \end{problem}
