\begin{problem}
A flow $S(t)$ is constrained by an arrival curve $\alpha$. The
flow is fed into a shaper, with shaping curve $\sigma$. We assume
that
$$
\alpha(s) = \min (m + ps, b +rs)
$$
and
$$
\sigma (s) = \min ( Ps, B+Rs )
$$
We assume that $p>r$, $m \leq b$ and $P \geq R$.

The shaper has a fixed buffer size equal to $X \geq m$. We require
that the buffer never overflows.

\begin{enumerate}
        \item Assume that $B=+\infty$.  Find the smallest
        of $P$ which guarantees that there is no buffer overflow.
        Let $P_{0}$ be this value.

        \item We do not assume that $B=+ \infty$ any more, but we
        assume that $P$ is set to the value $P_{0}$ computed in the
        previous question.  Find the value $(B_{0}, R_{0})$ of $(B,R)$  which
        guarantees that there is no buffer overflow and minimizes the cost
        function $c(B,R)= aB + R$, where $a$ is a positive constant.

        What is the
        maximum virtual delay if $(P, B, R)=(P_{0},B_{0}, R_{0})$~?
\end{enumerate}
