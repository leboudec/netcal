\begin{problem}
\begin{enumerate}
We say that a flow is $(P, B)$ constrained if it has
$\gamma_{P,B}$ as an arrival curve.
        \item  A trunk system has a buffer size of $B$ and a trunk bitrate of $P$.
Fill in the dots: (1) there is no loss if the input is $(., .)$
constrained (2) the output is $(.,.)$ constrained.

        \item  A $(P, B)$ constrained flow is fed into an infinite buffer served at a
        rate of $c$. What is the maximum delay~?
\end{enumerate}
