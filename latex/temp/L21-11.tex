\begin{problem}
Consider a guaranteed rate scheduler, with rate $R$ and delay $v$,
that receives a packet flow with cumulative packet length $L$. The
(packetized) scheduler output is fed into a constant bit rate
trunk with rate $c > R$ and propagation delay $T$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find a minimum service curve for the complete system.
 \sol{~\\
 The system is modelled by the concatenation
 $(N)(P^L)(S_{c,T})(P^L)$, where $N$ represents the scheduler.
 A minimum service curve for $(N)(P^L)$ is
 $S_{R,v+\frac{l_{\max}}{R}}$ and for $(\lambda_c)(P^L)$ is
 $S_{c,T+\frac{l_{\max}}{c}}$. Thus an end-to-end service curve is
 $S_{R,v+T+\frac{l_{\max}}{R}+\frac{l_{\max}}{c}}$.
 }
  \item Assume the flow of packets is $(r,b)$-constrained, with
  $b>l_{\max}$. Find a bound on the end-to-end delay and delay
  variation.
  \sol{~\\
  For the end-to-end delay is bound, we may omit the last packetizer. Thus
  a bound on the end-to-end delay is
  $$h(\gamma_{r,b}, S_{R,v+T+\frac{l_{\max}}{R}})
   = T+\frac{b+l_{\max}}{R}
  $$
  The minimum delay is $T + \frac{l_{\min}}{c}$ thus a bound on
  delay variation is
  $$
  v+\frac{b+l_{\max}}{R} - \frac{l_{\min}}{c}
  $$
}
\end{enumerate}
