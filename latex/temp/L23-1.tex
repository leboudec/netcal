\begin{problem}
Assume that $R \rightarrow (\tilde{\beta}, \beta) \rightarrow
R^*$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Show that the node offers to the flow a strict service
curve equal to $\tilde{\beta}\mpc \overline{\beta}$, where
$\overline{\beta}$ is the sub-additive closure of $\beta$.
  \item If $\tilde{\beta}=\beta$ is a rate-latency function, what is the
  value obtained for the strict service curve~?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
