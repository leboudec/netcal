\begin{problem}
Is it true that offering a service curve $\beta$ implies that,
during any busy period of length $t$, the amount of service
received rate is at least $\beta(t)$ ? \sol{No, the property means
that $\beta$ is a strict service curve. In general, a service
curve property is not strict. Consider for example a shaper. }
