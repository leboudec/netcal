 \nfs{another vl shaper}
 Let $\sigma$ be a good function. Consider the concatenation of a
 bit-by-bit greedy shaper, with curve $\sigma$, and an
 $L$-packetizer. Assume that $\sigma(0^+)=0$.
 Consider only inputs that are $L$-packetized
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Is this system a packetized shaper for $\sigma$ ?\sol{~No,
  the condition on $\sigma$ implies that a packetized shaper for
  $\sigma$ is a degenerate system, and this one is not.}
  \item Is it a packetized shaper for $\sigma+l_{\max}$ ?
  \sol{~This question is more reasonable. Indeed, since $P^L(x)
  \geq x -l_{\max}$, the answer is yes.}
  \item Is it a packetized greedy shaper for $\sigma+l_{\max}$ ?
  \sol{~This question is more difficult. In general, the answer is no.
  To see why, consider $\sigma(t)=rt$ and draw any sample path. With this
  system, the first packet is delayed by $\frac{l_1}{r}$ whereas the
  packetized greedy shaper for $rt + l_{\max}$ would not delay the
  first packet.}
\end{enumerate}
