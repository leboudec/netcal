\begin{problem}

\begin{enumerate}
        \item  Show that for a constant bit rate trunk with rate $c$, the backlog at
time $t$ is given by
$$
W(t) = \sup_{s \leq t} \left \{ R(t) - R^{*}(s) - c(t-s) \right \}
$$

        \item  What does the formula become if we assume only that,
        instead a constant bit rate trunk, the node is a scheduler
offering $\beta$ as a service curve~?
\end{enumerate}

\end{problem}
