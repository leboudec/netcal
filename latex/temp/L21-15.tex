\begin{problem}
A network consists of two nodes in tandem. There are $n_1$ flows
of type $1$ and $n_2$ flows of type $2$. Flows of type $i$ have
arrival curve $\alpha_i(t)=r_it+b_i$, $i=1,2$. All flows go
through nodes $1$ then $2$. Every node is made of a shaper
followed by an EDF scheduler. At both nodes, the shaping curve for
flows of type $i$ is some $\sigma_i$ and the delay budget for
flows of type $i$ is $d_i$. Every flow of type $i$ should have a
end-to-end delay bounded by $D_i$. Our problem is to find good
values of $d_1$ and $d_2$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We assume that $\sigma_i=\alpha_i$. What are the
  conditions on $d_1$ and $d_2$ for the end-to-end delay bounds to
  be satisfied ? What is the set of $(n_1, n_2)$ that are
  schedulable ?
  \item Same question if we set $\sigma_i=\lambda_{r_i}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
