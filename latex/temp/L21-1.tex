\begin{problem}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assume $K$ connections, each with peak rate $p$, sustainable rate
    $m$ and burst tolerance $b$, are offered to a trunk with constant
    service rate $P$ and FIFO buffer of capacity $X$. Find the
    conditions on $K$ for the system to be loss-free.
    \item If $Km =P$, what is the condition on $X$ for $K$
    connections to be accepted ?
    \item What is the maximum number of connection if $p$ = 2 Mb/s,
    $m$ = 0.2 Mb/s, $X= 10 $MBytes, $b=1 $Mbyte and $P=$ 0.1, 1, 2 or
    10 Mb/s ?
    \item For a fixed buffer size $X$, draw the acceptance
    region when $K$ and $P$ are the variables.
\end{enumerate}
