\begin{problem}
Consider the same assumptions as in \sref{sec-ringisstable} but
with a linear network instead of a ring. Thus node $m$ feeds node
$m+1$ for $m=1,..., M-1$; node $1$ receives only fresh traffic,
whereas all traffic exiting node $M$ leaves the network. Assume
that all service curves are strict. Find a bound which is finite
for $\nu \leq 1$. Compare to \thref{theo-ring}. \sol{Apply
\thref{theo-blindmux}}
\end{problem}
