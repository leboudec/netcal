\nfs{GCRA and Eff Bw, easy; GCRA and Eff Bw exam ED 99, modified
feb 99 by leb\\}
We consider a buffer of size $X$ cells, served at
a constant
        rate of $c$ cells per second.  We put $N$ identical connections into
        the buffer; each of the $N$ connections is constrained both by
        GCRA($T_{1}$, $\tau_{1}$) and GCRA($T_{2}$, $\tau_{2}$).  What is
        the maximum value of $N$ which is possible if we want to guarantee
        that there is no cell loss at all~?

        Give the numerical application for $T_{1}=0.5$~ms, $\tau_{1}=4.5$~ms,
        $T_{2}=5$~ms, $\tau_{2}=495$~ms, $c=10^6$~cells/second, $X=10^4$~cells
        \ifsol

        Call $e$ the effective bandwidth for a delay of $\frac{X}{c}$. The
        answer is the largest integer $\leq$ $\frac{c}{e}$.

        NA: $D=  \frac{X}{c} =10$ms. $e=11000/6$ cells/second. $N=6000/11 = 545$
