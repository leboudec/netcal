\begin{problem}
        Is Theorem ``Input-Output Characterization of Greedy Shapers" a stronger result
        than Corollary ``Service Curve offered by a Greedy Shaper"~?
\sol{ No, the theorem is equivalent to the corollary. Indeed, if
corollary is true, then
$$
R^*\geq R \mpc \sigma
$$
Now by the arrival curve property
$$
R* \leq R^* \mpc \sigma \leq R \otimes \sigma
$$
since $R^*\leq R$. Thus $R*=R\otimes \sigma.$ }
