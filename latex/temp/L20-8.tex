\begin{problem}
\begin{enumerate}
        \item For the following flows and a GCRA(100, 500), give the conformant and
  non-conformant cells. Times are in cell slots at the link rate.
  \begin{enumerate}
        \item  0, 100, 110, 12, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 1000, 1010
        \item  0, 100, 130, 160, 190, 220, 250, 280, 310, 1000, 1030
        \item  0, 10, 20, 300, 310, 320, 600, 610, 620, 800, 810, 820, 1000,
        1010, 1020, 1200, 1210, 1220, 1400, 1410, 1420, 1600, 1610, 1620
    \end{enumerate}

   \ifsol
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item  \texttt{+ + + + + + + - - - + +}
        \item  \texttt{+ + + + + + + + + + + +}
        \item  \texttt{20(+) - + + -}
        \end{enumerate}
\fi

        \item Assume that a cell flow has a minimum spacing of $\gamma$
        time units between cell emission times ($\gamma$ is the minimum
        time between the beginnings of two cell transmissions).  What is
        the maximum burst size for GCRA($T, \tau)$ ?  What is the minimum
        time between bursts of maximum size ?
\sol{
Considering $\gamma$ as the cell separation between cell beginnings,\\
Maximum burst size(MBS) = floor$\lfloor \frac{\tau}{T - \gamma}+1 \rfloor$\\
Minimum time between bursts = MBS$(T-\gamma)+\gamma$
}

        \item Assume that a cell flow has a minimum spacing between cells of
        $\gamma$ time units, and a minimum spacing between bursts of
        $T_{I}$. What is the maximum burst size ?
        \sol{Maximum burst size = floor$ \lfloor \frac{\min(T_{i}-T,\tau)}{T
-\gamma}+1 \rfloor $}
