\begin{problem}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Consider a packetized greedy shaper with shaping curve
  $\sigma(t)=rt$ for $t \geq 0$. Assume that $L(k)= k M$ where $M$ is fixed.
  Assume that the input is given by $R(t)=10 M$ for $t>0$ and $R(0)=0$. Compute
  the sequence $R^{(i)}(t)$ used in the representation of the output of the
  packetized greedy shaper, for $i=1,2,3,...$.
  \sol{
  The output $R^{(i)}(t)$ is a train of packets $m=1,...,10$, all of size $M$ at
  times $T^{(i)}_m = (m+i-1) \frac{M}{r}$. As $i$ goes to infinity,
  $R^{(i)}(t)$ goes to $0$, for any fixed $t$.}
  \item Same question if $\sigma(t)=(rt+ 2M) 1_\{t>0\}$.
  \sol{
  $T^{(1)}_1 = T^{(1)}_2 = 0$ and otherwise $T^{(1)}_m = (m-2) \frac{M}{r}$.
  For $i \geq 1$ we have
  $R^{(i)}=R^{(1)}$ since \thref{theo-psps} applies.}
