\begin{problem}
\begin{enumerate}
        \item  Consider the discrete
time function defined by
\begin{itemize}
        \item  $f(0)=0$
        \item  $f(1)=f(2)=a$
        \item  $f(i)=b$ for $i \geq 3$.
\end{itemize}

For which values of $a$ and $b$ is $f$ sub-additive~? \sol{$f$ is
subadditive iff $0 \leq b \leq 2a$.}
        \item  Is there equivalence between being concave and sub-additive~?
\sol{We have seen that if $f$ is concave and $f(0)=0$ then $f$ is
subadditive. The converse is not true: the function $f$ given
above is not concave.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
