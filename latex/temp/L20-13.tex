\begin{problem}
Show the following statements:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item  Consider a $(P,B)$ constrained flow, served at a rate $c\geq P$.
       The output is also $(P,B)$ constrained.
\sol{ We wish to compute the output $\alpha \mpd \beta$ where
$\alpha(t)=Pt+B$ and $\beta(t)=ct$.
$$
\alpha \mpd \beta(t) = Pt+B + \sup_{u\geq0} (P-c)u
$$
Since $P\leq c$, this is largest when $u=0$. Therefore $\alpha
\mpd \beta(t)=\alpha(t)$. }
 \item  Assume $a()$ has a bounded right-handside derivative.
        Then the output for a flow constrained by $a()$, served in a buffer
at a
        constant rate $c \geq \sup_{t \geq 0} a'(t)$, is also constrained by
        $a()$.
\sol{
$$
a \mpd \beta(t) = \sup_{u\geq0} a(t+u) -cu
$$
By the mean-value theorem there is a $v\in[t,t+u]$ such that
$$a(t+u) = a(t) + u a'(v).$$
Thus,
$$
a \mpd \beta(t) = a(t) + \sup_{u\geq0} (a'(v)-c)u
$$
Since all derivatives are smaller than $c$, this is at its
largest when $u=0$, giving $a \mpd \beta(t) = a(t)$. }
\end{enumerate}
