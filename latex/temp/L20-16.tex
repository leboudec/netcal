\begin{problem}

Consider a series of guaranteed service nodes with service curves
$c_{i}(t) = r_{i}(t-T_{i})^{+}$. What is the maximum delay through
this system for a flow constrained by $(m,b)$ ? \sol{Defining
\(T_0 = \sum_{\forall i} T_i \) and \(R_0 = min_{\forall i}
\{R_i\}\)
                \[ Max. Delay = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
                \frac{b}{R_0}+T_0 & \mbox{if $R_0>m$}\\
                \infty & \mbox{otherwise}
                \end{array}
                \right. \]
}
