[On-Off flows]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assume a data flow is periodical, with period $T$, and satisfies the
following: $r(t) = p$ for $0 \leq t < T_{0}$, and
$r(t) = 0$ for $T_{0}\leq t <  T$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw $R(t) = \int_{0}^{t} r(s) ds$

\item Find an arrival curve for the flow. Find the minimum arrival
curve for the flow.
\item Find the minimum $(r, b)$ such that
the flow is $(r, b)$ constrained.

\sol{An arrival curve could be $\alpha(t)=pt$\\
The minimal arrival curve is: \[ \alpha (t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
                R(t) & \mbox{if R(t) is sub-additive}\\
                inf\{\delta (t),\alpha (t),\alpha (t)\mpc\alpha (t),..\} & \mbox{otherwise}
                \end{array}
                \right. \]
When the flow is (r,b) contrained, the minimum (r,b) values are $r = \frac{p
T_{0}}{T}$, $b=T_{0} (p-r)$}

\end{enumerate}

\item A traffic flow uses a link with bitrate $P$ (bits/s). Data is
sent as packets of variable length. The flow is controlled by a leaky
bucket $(r, b)$. What is the maximum packet size ? What is the minimum
time interval between packets of maximum size ?

Application: P = 2 Mb/s, r = 0.2 Mb/s; what is the required burst
tolerance $b$
if the packet length is 2 Kbytes ? What is then the minimum
spacing between packets ?

\sol{
maximum packet size $L = p \frac{b}{p-r}$ \\
minimum time between packets $T_{m}=\frac{b}{r}$ \\
application: $b=L \frac{p-r}{p} = 1.8$Kbytes, $T_{m}=72$ ms.
